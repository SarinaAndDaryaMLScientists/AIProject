    "In this assignment, a Jupyter Notebook is prepared for examining almost all critical factors in designing a Machine Leaning model for a supervised learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete this notebook to build a ML model, and apply it to a binary classification problem. Additionally you will get familiar with varoius factors which may enhance the performance of a ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take advantage of four principal python libraries for data science and machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Numpy](https://numpy.org): The fundamental package for **scientific computing** with Python.\n",
    " - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): An open source **data analysis and manipulation tool**, built on top of the Python programming language.\n",
    " - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) : A comprehensive library for **creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations** in Python.\n",
    " - [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org): Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis and building Machine Learning models.\n",
    " \n",
    "**After this assignment you will be able to:**\n",
    "1. Run Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and know how to prepare data for a predictive model.\n",
    "2. Build and apply a Machine Learning model for a supervised learning problem using known frameworks.\n",
    " \n",

It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed.\n",
